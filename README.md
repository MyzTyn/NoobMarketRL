# NoobMarketRL

Welcome to **NoobMarketRL**! This project is a simple reinforcement learning setup for trading in a static market environment. It leverages the power of Stable Baselines3 and OpenAI's Gym to train an RL agent to make trading decisions based on market prices.

## Project Overview

**NoobMarketRL** is designed to demonstrate how reinforcement learning (RL) can be applied to a trading environment. The environment simulates a static market where prices oscillate between 0 and 1, and the novice agent learns to make trading decisions (Buy, Sell, or Hold) to maximize rewards.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Environment:** A custom trading environment built using Gymnasium.
- **Agent Training:** Uses the PPO algorithm from Stable Baselines3.
- **Visualization:** Dynamic plotting of market prices and agent actions during training.
